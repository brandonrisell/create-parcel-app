# create-parcel-app

A bare bones web app that I built from the ground up, wanted to avoid any generators or short cuts if I could to get a better understanding of how it all fits together.

## Current Tech/Features

- Parcel: Build tool, no config _yet_.
- React: UI framework
- ESLint: Static analysis in VSCode. Relying on their out of the box rules for now with additions for React, Jest, Babel, and Styled Components.
- Jest & Enzyme: Unit tests of react components.
- Styled Components: How we're pairing CSS styles with components.
- Babel: Handle our JSX, React, and Styled Components.
- Storybook: Component documentation and playground.
- Prettier: Using the out of the box rules in the VSCode extension.

## TODO

- Look into Husky integration with Prettier, Jest, and ESLint.
- Explore options for building a library vs an app.
- Explore more complex app features and state.
- Redux?
- Local Storage?
- PWA?
- Web Workers?
- Hooks? (Pshh, this is a given, who am I kidding)
- Backend? (How does a frontend and backend monorepo work with Parcel?)
